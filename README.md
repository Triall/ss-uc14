## Application Description
This application serves as a versatile platform engineered to provide a seamless user interface, capable of adapting to multiple locales. Through the integration of i18n with React, we ensure not only the translation of the text but also a tailored presentation of dates, currencies, and numerical data, all in accordance with the regional preferences (UA, EN, FR). In pursuit of offering an unparalleled user experience, our application has the built-in capability to dynamically switch between locales, promising an intuitive and inclusive interaction for a global audience.

Beyond mere translations, the application embodies a robust structure, proficient in handling varied formats of data, including date/time, numbers, and currencies, aligning with the local standards of the predefined locales. To safeguard the consistency and reliability of the user interface, an advanced error-handling mechanism has been implemented. This feature meticulously handles any missed translations or localizations, ensuring the stability and functionality of the application are never compromised, promising a smooth and error-free user journey.
